## About 
The 59th quadrennial US presidential election was held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. To win the election, the candidate needs as a minimum 270 out of 538 electoral votes. 

This project hopes to better explain the election results by use of official data, and aims to illustrate the answer to three questions, as defined below:

1. Which state had the absolute highest number of votes placed in the presidential election?
2. Which states were won by which candidate in the presidential election? 
3. What is the distribution of non-major party votes per state for the presidential election?

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/us-election-2020

## Libraries

For this project, Numpy, Pandas and Plotly were used.
